# Veryl corpus tests

The pinned `celox-test-suite-veryl` 0.8.0 corpus exercises:

```text
Veryl -> Struo RTL -> synthesis -> ECP5 mapping -> Celox 0.8.0 native simulation
```

CI enumerates every corpus case in the `Veryl corpus (Celox 0.8.0)` job on
pull requests and pushes to main. `Required CI` depends on this job. Known
unsupported/failing cases are skipped using exact names and reasons in
[veryl-suite-ignores.toml](veryl-suite-ignores.toml). They are reported as
`ignored`, never as passes. New failures outside that list fail the job;
there is no `continue-on-error`.

Each executed case runs in a separate process with a 60-second limit. Ignore
entries must exist in the pinned catalogue and cannot be duplicated. Use
`--include-ignored` to execute excluded cases and expose their actual outcomes.

The Actions job summary shows outcome counts. Download the
`veryl-corpus-results` artifact for per-case diagnostics, including after a
failed run. Reports are generated under `target/` and retained by Actions for
14 days; generated results and historical snapshots are not committed.

## Run locally

```sh
python3 scripts/check-veryl-suite.py
python3 scripts/check-veryl-suite.py --filter context_width:: --jobs 4
python3 scripts/check-veryl-suite.py --include-ignored --timeout 180 --report target/veryl-suite.json
cargo test --locked -p struo-frontend-veryl --test veryl_suite
```

The ordinary Rust tests cover selected corpus regressions and focused boundary
checks. The ignored worker/catalogue tests are entry points for the full runner;
`cargo test` alone does not run the complete corpus. The two known upstream
constant-folding regressions have explicit Rust `#[ignore]` reasons and can be
rerun by name with `-- --ignored`. Other regular regressions remain enabled.

For diagnostic comparison with Celox's source frontend:

```sh
python3 scripts/check-veryl-suite.py --reference --filter context_width:: \
  --report target/veryl-suite-reference.json
```

Reference runs do not apply Struo's ignore list. Reference results do not determine whether Struo passes. Some corpus cases are
build-only tests; passing them does not establish runtime correctness.

## Current limitations

The complete corpus is not yet passing. The adapter does not implement
four-state storage or internal/hierarchical observation after synthesis.
Unsupported lowering, analyzer errors, shared-reset clock-domain limitations,
and expensive wide designs remain documented exclusions. Veryl's constant folding
is left enabled. A known size-cast constant-expression mismatch therefore also
is explicitly ignored until the upstream behavior is fixed; it is not worked
around by globally disabling AIR constant folding.

The pinned corpus also requires an uninitialized constant-driven FF to start at
zero before its first clock. This is the suite's explicit two-state contract;
synthesis treats the unspecified source initialization as a don't-care.
Upstream https://github.com/celox-sim/celox/pull/917 separates initialization
coverage from constant-folding coverage. The pinned expectation is unchanged
here and is explicitly ignored until that change is available.

A no-op tick is permitted only for a source RTL register clock when the mapped
design has no state cells or event handlers. Unknown clocks are not accepted as
eliminated events. All output assertions still execute.
